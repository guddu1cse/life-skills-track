# Tiny Habits

### Question 1  
The most interesting idea in the video was the concept of starting with a habit that is so small it feels impossible to fail. For example, committing to flossing just one tooth or doing just one push-up can be the beginning of a larger habit. This shows how small successes can grow into life-changing routines.

### Question 2  
B = MAP stands for **Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt**.  
To make new habits easier:  
- **M (Motivation):** Keep motivation in mind, but don’t rely solely on it. Choose habits that align with what you genuinely care about.  
- **A (Ability):** Simplify the action by making it small and easy to perform (e.g., doing 2 squats instead of 20).  
- **P (Prompt):** Use effective prompts or triggers like linking the habit to an existing routine (e.g., “After brushing my teeth, I will floss one tooth”).  

By optimizing these three factors, starting and maintaining new habits becomes much easier.

### Question 3  
Celebrating after completing a habit is crucial because it creates a positive association with the action. When you “shine” or celebrate, you signal to your brain that the action is rewarding and worth repeating. This emotional reinforcement increases the likelihood of the habit becoming automatic.

# 1% Better Every Day Video

### Question 4  
The most interesting idea was the "1% improvement" principle: instead of trying to make dramatic changes, focus on improving by just 1% every day. Over time, these small improvements compound into significant transformations. For example, consistently saving small amounts or walking an extra 100 steps daily can lead to major results.

# Book Summary of Atomic Habits

### Question 5  
The book emphasizes that **identity drives behavior**. Instead of focusing on outcomes, focus on becoming the type of person who achieves those outcomes. For example, instead of saying, “I want to lose weight,” say, “I am a healthy person.” By shifting your identity, your actions naturally align with that belief.

### Question 6  
To make a habit easier to do, the book suggests:  
- **Reduce friction:** Eliminate obstacles that make the habit difficult. For instance, lay out your workout clothes the night before.  
- **Start small:** Shrink the habit to something easy, like reading one page instead of committing to an entire book.  
- **Use tools and systems:** Automate tasks or create a supportive environment to make the habit effortless.

### Question 7  
To make a habit harder to do, the book suggests:  
- **Increase friction:** Add barriers or steps that make the habit inconvenient. For example, delete distracting apps from your phone or keep junk food out of your home.  
- **Change the environment:** Rearrange your space so the habit becomes less accessible (e.g., put your phone in another room during work hours).  
- **Add consequences:** Tie negative outcomes to the habit, like setting penalties for skipping an important task.

1. **Cue (Invisible):** Remove apps from the home screen and turn off notifications.  
2. **Unattractive:** Remind myself of wasted time and how it prevents me from achieving goals.  
3. **Hard:** Set time limits on apps or use apps like Focus Mode to block access.  
4. **Unsatisfying:** Reflect on the unproductive feeling after using social media excessively.
