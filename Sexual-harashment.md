# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment can involve a wide range of behaviors, including but not limited to:

1. **Physical harassment**: Unwelcome physical contact such as touching, patting, or blocking someone’s path.
2. **Verbal harassment**: Making inappropriate or offensive comments, jokes, or remarks about someone’s gender, appearance, or personal life.
3. **Non-verbal harassment**: Displaying offensive gestures, staring, or sharing explicit images or messages.
4. **Power dynamics**: Demanding sexual favors in exchange for professional opportunities or creating a hostile environment by abusing authority.
5. **Cyber harassment**: Sending inappropriate emails, messages, or content through digital platforms.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
If I face or witness any incident of sexual harassment, I would:

1. **Stay calm and document the incident**: Record details such as the date, time, location, and description of the incident.
2. **Speak up**: Politely but firmly communicate to the person that their behavior is unwelcome and inappropriate.
3. **Report the incident**: Notify the relevant authority, such as the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) or HR department, as per the organization’s policy.
4. **Seek support**: Discuss the situation with a trusted colleague, mentor, or counselor for emotional support.
5. **Follow up**: Ensure the complaint is addressed and appropriate action is taken by the authorities.

By taking these actions, I aim to contribute to creating a safe and respectful environment for everyone.
