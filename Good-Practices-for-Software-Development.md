# Good Practices for Software Development

## 1. Gathering Requirements

* Make notes while discussing requirements with your team.
* Ask questions and seek clarity during the meeting itself, as it’s often difficult to reconvene the same group of people later.
* If your team doesn’t use tools like Trello or Jira for documentation, write down the requirements yourself and share them with the team. This ensures immediate feedback and serves as a reference for future discussions.
* When requirements are unclear despite efforts, get frequent feedback during implementation to stay on track and ensure everyone is aligned.

## 2. Always Over-Communicate: Some Scenarios

* **Requirements have changed?** If changes will affect deadlines, inform relevant team members about the updated timeline.  
* **Facing issues like no internet/electricity/laptop problems?** Notify the team immediately.  
* **Unexpected delays?** Communicate the issue and inform team members about the updated progress.  
* Use group chats/channels over private DMs, as it ensures more visibility and quicker responses.  
* Don’t miss calls. If unavailable, take the call and inform them you'll call back in 5-10 minutes, then follow up.  
* Keep your video on during meetings to build rapport and improve communication.

## 3. Stuck? Ask Questions  

* Clearly explain the problem and describe what you’ve already tried. Avoid vague messages like "the build is not working" or "the database is not connecting."  
* Use screenshots, diagrams, or screencast tools (like Loom) to explain the issue visually.  
* Share code snippets via GitHub Gists or use tools like Codepen or Codesandbox for complete setups.  
* Observe how issues are reported in large open-source projects for guidance on framing your questions effectively.

## 4. Get to Know Your Teammates  

* Spend time understanding the company, product, and team members to improve collaboration.  
* Join meetings 5-10 minutes early to have casual conversations with your teammates.  
* Learn your teammates’ work schedules and plan calls when they are free.

## 5. Be Aware and Mindful of Other Team Members  

* If someone can’t join a call, send a concise message instead. Combine all your questions into a single message rather than multiple ones.  
* Be available to respond quickly when they reply to your message, as real-time conversations are more efficient than drawn-out exchanges.  
* Remember that your teammates have their own work; choose the right communication method based on the situation.

## 6. Doing Things with 100% Involvement  

* Remote work is still work, and programming requires sustained, focused attention.  
* Practice preserving attention as a skill—this improves with time.  
* Work with deep focus: **Work when you work, play when you play.**  
* Keep your phone on silent, disable unnecessary notifications, and only allow work-related apps to notify you.  
* Block social media during work hours using tools like TimeLimit or Freedom.  
* Track your time with apps like Boosted to improve productivity.  
* Manage your food intake—avoid eating too little or too much to maintain concentration.  
* Exercise regularly to keep your energy levels high throughout the day.
