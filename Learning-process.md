### Question 3  
**What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**  
Active mode involves concentrated effort on a specific task, such as solving a problem or studying a concept. Diffused mode, on the other hand, is a relaxed mental state where the brain processes information subconsciously, often leading to creative insights and connections. Both modes complement each other, with active mode helping to focus and diffused mode allowing ideas to settle and integrate.
